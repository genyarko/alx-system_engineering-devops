In this diagram:

The user's computer represents the device from which a user accesses the website.
The DNS server translates the domain name to the server's IP address.
The load balancer (HAProxy) is added to distribute incoming requests across multiple web servers for scalability and high availability.
The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests, serves static files, and acts as a reverse proxy for the application server.
The application server executes the website's code base, generates dynamic content, and handles the application logic.
The database server (MySQL) stores and manages the website's data.
The load balancer is configured as a cluster with another load balancer for redundancy and improved fault tolerance.
Explanation for additional elements:

Separate servers for web server, application server, and database:

This separation allows each component to have dedicated resources and optimize their performance independently.
It enables scaling each component individually based on their specific requirements.
It improves fault isolation and minimizes the impact of issues or failures on other components.
Load balancer (HAProxy) in a clustered configuration:

Load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple web servers to ensure efficient utilization of resources and handle increased traffic.
Clustering the load balancers provides redundancy and high availability. If one load balancer fails, the other can take over seamlessly.
It improves the scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance of the infrastructure.
