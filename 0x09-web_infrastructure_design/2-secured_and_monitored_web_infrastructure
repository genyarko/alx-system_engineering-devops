In this diagram:

The user's computer represents the device from which a user accesses the website.
The DNS server translates the domain name "www.foobar.com" to the server's IP address.
Three firewalls are added for improved network security. They help filter and control incoming and outgoing traffic, protecting the infrastructure from unauthorized access or malicious activity.
The load balancer performs SSL termination, decrypting HTTPS traffic and forwarding it to the web servers.
Web Server 1 and Web Server 2 handle incoming HTTP requests, serving static files and acting as reverse proxies.
Application Server 1 and Application Server 2 execute the website's code base, generating dynamic content.
The database server (MySQL) stores and manages the website's data.
An SSL certificate is added to enable HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication between the users and the website.
Three monitoring clients are included to collect data and send it to a monitoring tool such as Sumo Logic or other monitoring services.
Monitoring is used to track and analyze various aspects of the infrastructure, including performance, availability,
